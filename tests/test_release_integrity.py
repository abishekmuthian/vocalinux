"""Guard what a published release promises about itself.

v0.16.1 shipped four assets — two AppImages of ~100 MB, a wheel and an sdist —
with no checksum, no signature and no provenance, in a project that pins the
digest of all 67 models it downloads. It also built the same version three times
on three runners (`build-and-release`, `build-appimage-arm64`, `publish-pypi`),
so the wheel on PyPI was never the wheel on the GitHub release, and a checksum
for one would not have described the other.

These tests pin the shape of the fix: build once, publish that, and cover every
artifact with one manifest. Parsed as text rather than YAML on purpose — the
sibling workflow guards do the same, and the only YAML parser on hand reaches
the venv transitively through pre-commit.
