"""Point the Flatpak's dependency manifest at the versions uv.lock resolved.

`packaging/flatpak/python3-dependencies.yaml` was produced once by
flatpak-pip-generator, from a package list typed out by hand on the command
line recorded in its first line, and then hand-edited. Nothing regenerated it
afterwards and no test compared it to anything, so it drifted: by 2026-09-10 ten
of its fifteen shared packages were behind `requirements/runtime.txt`, including
pywhispercpp, which sat at 1.4.1 under the project's own `>=1.5.0` floor. The
Flatpak installs the project with `pip3 install --no-deps`, so that constraint
is never evaluated and nothing there could notice.

This script closes the loop the other way round: it reads the hash-pinned export
that `just lock` produces and rewrites every source in the manifest to the
artifact whose digest uv already recorded. The bytes the Flatpak downloads are
then the bytes in `uv.lock`, verified by hash rather than by convention.

It edits in place rather than regenerating, because two things in that file are
hand-written and no generator produces them: pywhispercpp's Vulkan build with
its version injection, and the symlinking of whisper.cpp's shared libraries onto
the loader path. Keeping the structure keeps the diff to versions and digests.

Usage:
    python scripts/sync_flatpak_deps.py            # rewrite the manifest
    python scripts/sync_flatpak_deps.py --check    # report drift, change nothing

`tests/test_flatpak_packaging.py` asserts the same invariant offline, so CI
catches drift without reaching PyPI.
