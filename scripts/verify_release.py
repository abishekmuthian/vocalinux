"""Check that a published release verifies as published.

The guards in tests/ read workflow files, so none of them can see what a
release looks like once its run has finished. This reads the release:

  manifest    SHA256SUMS is attached, lists every other asset, and its digests
              match the bytes GitHub stores
  provenance  every artifact the manifest lists resolves in the attestations API
  notes       the body still tells users how to check both
  pypi        the wheel and the sdist on PyPI are the bytes on the release

Nothing is downloaded: GitHub reports a sha256 for every asset it stores, and an
asset it reports none for fails rather than being skipped.

Usage: scripts/verify_release.py [tag] [--if-published]
       Default tag: the latest stable release. --if-published passes a tag that
       published nothing.
