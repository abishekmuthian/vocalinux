# Install what build.sh needs on a bare base image, then run it.
#
# The AppImage inherits the glibc and the GTK stack of whatever host builds it,
# so the host is a pinned input like any other: `base-image` in
# tool_checksums.txt. This script is the part that runs inside that image; the
# way in is docker-build.sh, which both CI and `just appimage` call:
#
#   bash packaging/appimage/docker-build.sh dist/vocalinux-0.16.0-py3-none-any.whl 0.16.0 dist
#
# Only the interpreter and the Python packages are pinned by digest; these apt
# packages are whatever the pinned image resolves to. That is the trade the base
# image makes: its archive is frozen enough for this to be stable, and pinning
# every .deb would cost more than it protects.
