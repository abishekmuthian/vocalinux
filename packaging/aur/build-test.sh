#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build the AUR package from this checkout, on Arch as it is today.
#
# Usage (the read-only repo mount is enough — the tree is taken via git archive):
#   docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo:ro" archlinux:latest \
#     bash /repo/packaging/aur/build-test.sh
#   or: just aur-gate
#
# This is the gate #757 needed: Arch extra moved to setuptools 84 while
# build-system.requires still capped it below 82, so the PKGBUILD's
# --no-isolation build broke for AUR users — and nothing ever ran makepkg on
# the PKGBUILD before a tag published it.
# The published source= points at the tag tarball, which does not exist until
# the tag is pushed, so the gate replaces it with a git archive of HEAD under
# the same filename: build()/package() run unchanged, and the gate answers
# "does this commit build on Arch", not "did the last tag build".
#
# Not this gate's, despite reaching Arch users: #736 came through install.sh,
# not through this package. The AUR build of v0.16.0 was intact, because the
# tree it built carried neither model_checksums.txt nor the code reading it.
# Closing that one takes a build gate for install.sh, not for this package.
#
# Deliberately archlinux:latest, unpinned: the AUR is a rolling channel and
# #757 was Arch moving under us. A pinned image would test a world that no
# longer exists.
#
# Two depends cannot come from the repos: python-pywhispercpp is a virtual
# name that the AUR -cpu/-cuda/-rocm backends provide (#579), and
# python-pynput lives in the AUR itself. A stub package with provides=()
# satisfies them so makepkg verifies the full depends set; for the import
# smoke they are pip-installed from the hash-pinned requirements/runtime.txt,
# so the smoke runs the versions we pin, not whatever AUR ships — that drift
# (AUR -cpu is still 1.4.x) is a monitoring job, not this gate.
#
# What the smoke therefore does NOT prove: that depends=() is complete. This
# container carries base-devel and python-pip with their own closures, and the
# two names above arrive via pip --no-deps, so a missing *direct* dependency
# still passes. Transitive ones are the provider's to declare — the backend
# providing python-pywhispercpp declares python-platformdirs itself.
